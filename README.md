# FernandoApexa

## Description
This project is a technical assessment demonstrating proficiency in .NET 8, ASP.NET Web API, C#, Entity Framework (In-memory DB) with AutoMapper, Memory Cache using MRU (Most Recently Used), MediatR Pattern, and Xunit/Moq/Shouldly for tests. This is the Backend project that contains CRUD for Advisors.

## Features
- **.NET 8**: Leveraging the latest features and enhancements of .NET for optimal performance and maintainability.
- **ASP.NET Web API**: Building a robust API to facilitate seamless communication between clients and servers.
- **C#**: Implementing the backend logic with the expressive and powerful C# language.
- **Entity Framework (In-memory DB) with AutoMapper**: Utilizing Entity Framework for data access with an in-memory database, enhanced by AutoMapper for streamlined object-to-object mapping.
- **Cache using MRU**: Implementing a cache mechanism using MRU (Most Recently Used) strategy for efficient data caching and retrieval.
- **MediatR Pattern**: Employing the MediatR pattern for clean and maintainable separation of concerns, enabling easy handling of commands and queries.
- **XUnit/Moq/Shouldly for Tests**: Ensuring the reliability and correctness of the codebase through comprehensive unit tests using XUnit for testing framework, Moq for mocking dependencies, and Shouldly for fluent assertions.
